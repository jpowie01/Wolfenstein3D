# Wolfenstein 3D
Basic implementation of Wolfenstein 3D engine. It was written a long time ago in just 48 hours and I've recently
decided to publish it on my GitHub profile. Now, I know that I could do this a lot better :) Maybe one day I will
try to rewrite it to simplify the code and optimize rendering scene.

## Technology
- C++
- SDL
- OpenGL 2.1
